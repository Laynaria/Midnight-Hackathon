## Context

This repository is the repo of the Wild Code School "Remote" Midnight team from 2022/2023 during the Hackathon from January 11 to 13, 2023 in partnership with AWS (Amazon Web Services).

## Concept

Our concept, defined and developed in less than 48 hours, is to be the first electric vehicle rental platform based on an environmentally friendly approach. Indeed, according to criteria such as the distance to be covered, the number of people on board and the reason of the journey (work, leisure, etc.), we propose electric vehicles really adapted to the need.

Complemented by the presence of sensors in the vehicles to encourage eco-responsible driving, we assign an "ecological" rating in the form of a sheet to encourage eco-responsible rentals.
